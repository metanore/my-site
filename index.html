            <p class="w3-large w3-center"> - A paracosm is a detailed imaginary world. 
Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. 
The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship wit h this subjective universe,
 which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions.
 Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over
 a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood.</p>
