            <p2 class="w3-large w3-center"> "A paracosm is a detailed imaginary world. 
Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. 
The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, 
which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, 
it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, 
as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood."</p2>
